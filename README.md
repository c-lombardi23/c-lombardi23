### About Me

I am a dedicated student and aspiring machine learning engineer with a strong foundation in Physics. This background has equipped me with a rigorous, first-principles approach to problem-solving, which I now apply to building robust, end-to-end machine learning systems. My expertise lies in moving projects from initial concept and data analysis through to model development, validation, and deployment. I thrive on solving complex challenges with clean, maintainable, and well-architected code.

My primary interests include:
-  **Applied Machine Learning:** Developing intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.
-  **MLOps & Tooling:** Building the infrastructure for training, validation, and explainability.
-  **Software Engineering:** Writing high-quality, scalable, and well-documented Python code.

#### [Fiber Cleave Image Analysis & Automated Correction](https://github.com/c-lombardi23/ImageProcessingClone)
An end-to-end system for automating the quality inspection of fiber optic cleaves.

- **Problem:** Replaced a slow, manual, and subjective inspection process with an automated, data-driven solution.
- **Solution:**
  - Developed a **multi-modal CNN classifier** to identify cleave defects with high precision.
  - Implemented **XGBoost & MLP regression models** to predict the exact corrective tension needed.
  - Built a **Reinforcement Learning agent** (`Stable-Baselines3`) to learn optimal correction policies in a simulated environment.
- **Key Features:**
  - **Comprehensive MLOps Pipeline:** Features a modular data factory, a hyperparameter tuning system with `KerasTuner`, and robust evaluation scripts.
  - **Explainability:** Integrated **Grad-CAM++** to visualize model focus and ensure trustworthiness.
  - **Configuration Management:** Used **Pydantic** for robust, typed configuration, driving a flexible command-line interface.
